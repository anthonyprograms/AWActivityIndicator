# AWActivityIndicator

## How do I use it?
The size of the activity indicator is (120,120) and centered in the middle. 
There are 3 path selections to choose from: diamond (default), star and arrow.

* `activity.startAnimating()` displays the activity indicator
* `activity.stopAnimation()` removes the activity indicator from the view
* `activity.setActivityBackgroundColor(UIColor)` sets the background color of the indicator
* `activity.setDotColor(UIColor)` sets the color of the dots
* `activity.setNameOfPath(pathName)` pathName could be "star", "diamond" or "arrow"
